- Hi, I’m @Son-Kha or Sonia Khan. My other handle is cosmicfox.
- I’m interested in making games more accessible to disabled audiences and am joining game jams and discord servers to learn and develop more as a coder.
- Thanks to a wonderful mentor at Limit Break, I'm learning how to make my own 2D game on Unity. I’m also currently learning C++, C#, Unity UI, and nodeJSL.
<!---
My goals are to make a great portfolio as I gain further skills in game dev.
